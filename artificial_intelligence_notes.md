# Artificial intelligence with python

**What is AI?**

"The area of computer science that studies how machines can perform tasks that would normally require a sentient angent."

"The area of computer science that studies how machines can closely imitate human intelligence."


**Machine learning:** Is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on getting machines to make decisions by feeding them data.  
**Deep learning:** Is a subset of Machine Learning that uses the concept of neural networks to solve complex problems.

**Examples**

- Self driven cars  
- Search engines  
- AI gamers  
- Home monitoring  
- Recommendation systems  
- Medical diagnosis  
- Insurance pricing

**Turing test**

Test "the ability to achieve human-level intelligence during a coversation" by:

- Interrogate the machine through text interface.  
- The human cannot know who they are talking to.  
- The human interacts with two entities (respondents; one human, one machine)  

The machine passes the test if the interrogator is unable to teel which one is the machine and which one is human.

**levels of thought**

- Geometric  
- Kinematic  
- Physical  
- Behavioral  
- Cognitive  

**Rationality within AI:** observe a set of rules and following their logical implications in order to achieve a desirable outcome. 

**Steps in machine learning pipeline**

- Problem definition  
- Data ingestion  
- Data preparation  
- Data segregation  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation  
- Model deployment  
- Performance monitoring:  
	- how accurate are the predictions.
	- Operational performance including CPU utilization, memory usage, disk usage, network traffic, latency (the time it takes for data transfer to occur), throughput (the amount of data succesfully transferred).


**Feature selection** (or variable/attribute selection)

- Method to select features from an initial dataset.  
- This is an important part which can: shorten training time, simplify models and enhance testing set performance.

- Redundant features: doesn't provide much nre information.  
- Irrelevant feature: Low correlation to target feature --> noise.
